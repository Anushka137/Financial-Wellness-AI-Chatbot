Assistant: Looking at your savings goals, you have 3 active goals:
- Emergency Fund: 50% complete ($2,500 of $5,000)
- Vacation Fund: 40% complete ($800 of $2,000)

2. Your savings rate of 66.17% is excellent - keep up the good work!

## Advanced Usage

cd client && python mcp_client.py
```

Available MCP tools:
- `get_transactions` - Fetch transaction history
- `add_transaction` - Add new expense/income
- `get_budget_status` - Check budget vs actual spending
- `get_savings_goals` - Retrieve savings goals
- `create_savings_goal` - Set new savings target

### API Direct Access

You can also interact with the API directly:

```bash
# Get all transactions
curl http://localhost:8000/transactions

# Get budget status
curl http://localhost:8000/budget

# Get analytics
curl http://localhost:8000/analytics

# Get recommendations
curl http://localhost:8000/recommendations

# Generate a chart
curl http://localhost:8000/charts/spending_by_category
```

## Sample Data

The system comes with sample financial data including:
- 15 sample transactions (expenses and income)
- 6 budget categories with limits
- 3 savings goals with progress
- User profile and analytics

You can modify `financial_data.json` to add your own data or use the API to add transactions programmatically.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - Instead of "show me spending", try "show me my food spending for this month"

2. **Use natural language** - The AI understands conversational queries like "How am I doing with my budget?"

3. **Ask for insights** - Use queries like "Give me financial advice" or "What are my spending patterns?"

4. **Use the interactive mode** - It maintains conversation context for better responses

5. **Generate charts** - Visual data can be more helpful than text summaries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No Google API key provided"**
   - Edit `config.json` and add your Gemini API key
   - Get a free key from https://aistudio.google.com/

2. **"API request failed"**
   - Make sure the server is running: `python api_server.py`
   - Check that the API URL in config.json is correct

3. **"No data found"**
   - The system comes with sample data in `financial_data.json`
   - Add your own transactions using the API or edit the JSON file

### Getting Help

- Check the setup guide: `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Use the quick start script: `python quick_start.py`

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basic usage:

3. **Integrate with other tools** - Use the MCP server with other AI agents
